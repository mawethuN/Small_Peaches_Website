            <p>
                Welcome to the Projects page, where we proudly present four animated works created during our semester-long journey. 
                Each project is a reflection of our growth as animators and storytellers, showcasing different techniques, styles, and themes. 
                As a team of three, weâ€™ve collaborated to bring these animations to life, pouring our creativity and technical skills into every frame. 
                Explore the stories we've crafted, and witness the evolution of our skills as we navigate the world of animation. 
                We hope these projects inspire and entertain, just as much as we enjoyed creating them!

                        The Fak'ugesi Animation Jam was an intense 48-hour creative challenge where we were tasked with producing an animated video from start to finish. 
                        With the theme centered around South African hip hop, we drew inspiration from the vibrant culture and music that defines the genre. 
                        It was a whirlwind of collaboration, creativity, and innovation, as we pushed our skills to the limit to bring our animated vision to life within the tight deadline.
