            <p>
                The project is a 3-to-5-minute animation based on the Animation IV project by group members Bumani Maroleni and Mawethu Nala. 
                The animation will be taken from the initial animation and expanded upon. It is essentially a proof of concept ideal for a portfolio for animation. 
                The animation will be complete with rendered visuals, SFX and voice acting. The project will be done throughout semester 2. 
                It's a great opportunity to showcase our animating skills, create a powerful narrative and produce a high-quality animation piece to showcase in our professional portfolios.

            <h2>NARRATIVE BREAKDOWN</h2>
            <p>
                It's pretty much a narrative that follows two protagonists, Felix and Nandi, who are combat units for the Counter Incursion Force (C.I.F) The C.I.F is a global military organization formed by many countries to defend Earth from the Colossi that regularly invade the planet. 
                The Colossi are sent to Earth to kill all the inhabitants and prepare the planet for their kind. Initially, the nations decided to use nukes against these monsters but it wasnâ€™t a viable option because it resulted in uninhabitable zones for humans. 
                Biologists began to do some research on the creatures and discovered a gene-altering chemical in the blood of the monsters. They then developed a serum that turns humans superhuman allowing them to fight the giant monsters. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Nandi and Felix are among the latest generation of these super soldiers and are regularly sent to fight the monsters whenever they invade. 
                The reason they use children is because the serum produces stronger soldiers when used on them before puberty so that their bodies can eventually develop with the serum being part of them. 
                As they grow older, they grow stronger and faster, making them more effective than those injected during or after puberty. 
                The problem is that the monsters keep coming and soldiers are sent to the battlefield at younger years. 
                Every fight is tough and either ends with the monster dead or the city or populated area nuked if they fail to kill the monster. 
                The whole theme around the narrative is "How far will humanity go to survive?"
