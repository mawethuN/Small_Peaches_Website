                Small Peaches recently participated in the Fak'ugesi Animation Jam, a fast-paced 48-hour hackathon where the team was challenged to create an original animated video centered around the theme of South African hip hop. 
                With only two days to bring their concept to life, each member brought unique skills and creative energy, collaborating on everything from storyboarding and character design to animation and final touches. 
                This intense experience pushed Small Peaches to think quickly and work efficiently, blending elements of local culture with expressive animation techniques to capture the theme. 
                The result was a vibrant and dynamic piece that celebrated both their artistic abilities and the spirit of South African hip hop. Members of Small Peaches were split up and put into groups whereby it was encouraged to work together to win a grand prize.
                There were two groups that Small Peaches was split into, namely Y2K and Numero Uno

            <h2>TEAM NUMERO UNO</h2>

                    <p>
                        Team Numero Uno consisted of 4 people, two of which were from SMall Peaches.
                        Jez and Mauwii partook in the Fak'ugesi Animation Jam with two other members.
                        Unfortunately team Numero Uno did not emerge victorious, but a large effort was made by each member to produce quality work throughout the 48 hours with 3 members staying at the precinct overnight trying to finish the work.
                        In future, more cooperation and teamwork could have made a difference.
