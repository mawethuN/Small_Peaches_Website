        <h1>MEET THE PEACHES</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the individual portfolios of the Peaches! Each of us brings a unique set of skills that we’ve mastered throughout our degree. 
            While we’ve worked together as a team, our portfolios reflect our personal journeys and creative growth. 
            Whether it's character animation, background design, or sound and voice engineering, each Peach showcases their specialized talents. 
            Take a look and explore the diverse skills that contribute to the strength of our collective projects.

                HAY!

            <P>
                I'm Mauwii! I'm currently in my final year at Digital Arts.
                I'm the web developer and designer of Small Peaches.
                I have a deep passion for all things design and colour coordination.
                I enjoy character design and UI/UX design.
                I mainly design personal websites each with their own aesthetic.
                I'm quite passionate about colours and design, and believe that everything has its own aesthetic to be shown using the correct colours.

            <h2>LUTHO</h2>
            <P>
                I'm Lutho, an animator, storyboard artist, and illustrator with a deep passion for animation. 
                My goal is to master animating so I can create visually stunning short films that explore psychological and action-driven stories, often as seen in Love, Death and Robots. 
                I draw inspiration from shows like Adventure Time and Steven Universe, with my style rooted in the charm of Cartoon Network. 
                Narratively, I'm inspired by the unique storytelling seen in Love, Death & Robots.

                Hi, I’m Bumani Jezreel Maroleni. I’m an artist who specializes in concept art, art direction, animation, storyboarding and writing. 
                How I found myself doing these things is pretty much the same for a lot of people out there. 
                I was a kid who fell in love with animated media and comics. The joy that they brought to my world inspired me to try to create media that would bring the same joy to others. 
                I want to create stories told through visual mediums that can spark the same kind of desire to create that was sparked in me. 
                With a deep love and appreciation for more visual media than I could realistically list in this bio, I hope to do my part in creating more works of art for the world to enjoy.
