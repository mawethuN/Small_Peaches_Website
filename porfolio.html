            <P>
                Hi, I’m Mauwii! I’m currently working towards a BA in Digital Arts at the University of the Witwatersrand, majoring in Animation and Interactive Media. 
                For this project, I took charge of designing and building the website from scratch. 
                It was such a rewarding experience to blend my love for coding with a dash of creativity to bring our project’s theme to life online. 
                From coordinating colors to setting up the flow, I made sure every visual and interactive detail fit perfectly with the overall vibe we wanted to create.
            </P>
            <p>
                I’m passionate about character design, finding that perfect color scheme, and crafting aesthetics that truly connect with a project’s theme. 
                Wireframing and UI/UX design are my jam, so I loved shaping an experience that’s both user-friendly and visually exciting. 
                There’s just something amazing about watching a project come together when it all clicks, and I’m thrilled to have put my animation and interactive media skills to work to make this one really stand out!
            </p>

                I'm Lutho, an animator, storyboard artist, and illustrator with a deep passion for animation. 
                My goal is to master animating so I can create visually stunning short films that explore psychological and action-driven stories, often as seen in Love, Death and Robots. 
                I draw inspiration from shows like Adventure Time and Steven Universe, with my style rooted in the charm of Cartoon Network. 
                Narratively, I'm inspired by the unique storytelling seen in Love, Death & Robots.
            </P>

                Hi, I’m Bumani Jezreel Maroleni. I’m an artist who specializes in concept art, art direction, animation, storyboarding and writing. 
                How I found myself doing these things is pretty much the same for a lot of people out there. 
                I was a kid who fell in love with animated media and comics. The joy that they brought to my world inspired me to try to create media that would bring the same joy to others. 
                I want to create stories told through visual mediums that can spark the same kind of desire to create that was sparked in me. 
                With a deep love and appreciation for more visual media than I could realistically list in this bio, I hope to do my part in creating more works of art for the world to enjoy.
