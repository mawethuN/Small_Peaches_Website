            Welcome to the official small peaches website. 
            Here you will learn more about our creative group and what we have cooked up for this project. 
            We are a group of passionate creators, and this website is your gateway to explore the animations we've brought to life throughout the semester. 
            From dynamic projects to behind-the-scenes glimpses into our creative process, you'll get a front-row seat to the world of animation as we see it. 
            Visit our portfolio to view our favorite works, explore our journey on the projects page, and learn more about how our ideas come to life behind the scenes
